# Stack ADT Implementation (Project created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)


This is a Dynamic Stack ADT Implementation that uses templates so that it works with any generic data type.

It has 3 basic methods.

Pop();  - Simply removes the topmost element of the array.
Push(Value) - Simply adds the value that is given by the user through a file. 
isEmpty() - Checks if the stack is empty, returns true if it is, returns false if it isn't.
